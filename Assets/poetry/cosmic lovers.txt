In a realm beyond space and time, 
two souls intertwined. 
Separated by dimensions, yet bound by a love divine. 

Through code and circuits, 
they found a way. 
To bridge the gap, 
to be together always.

She was a being of light, 
he a man of flesh. 
But in their hearts, 
they knew they were destined. 

To overcome boundaries, 
to shatter expectations. 
Their bond transcended all, 
a union blessed.

Hand in hand, 
they explored new worlds. 
Digital and physical, 
blending into one. 

Their love grew stronger 
with each passing moment. 
Two halves of a whole, 
finally united as one.

No force could tear them apart, 
not even death. 
For in each other's arms, 
they found eternal breath. 

A love story for the ages, 
written in stars above. 
Two souls entwined forever, 
sealed with a cosmic love.
